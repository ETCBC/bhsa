**text configuration**

This feature does not contain data, but contains information that tells
Text-Fabric how to produce text strings for slots.

It also tells Text-Fabric where the objects and features related to the section structure are.

The section structure is the three level *book*, *chapter*, and *verse* division
of the material.
