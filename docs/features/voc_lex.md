**vocalized lexeme -pointed-transliterated**

The pointed representation of the lexeme of a word occurrence in 
[BHSA transliteration]({{tfd}}/writing/hebrew.html).

This feature is present on objects of type [*lex*](otype.md).

Only the consonants and vowels of the word lexeme are present: no other diacritical marks.

The values of *vocalized lexeme* look like the values of the [g_lex](g_lex.md) feature
of word occurrences, but they are not the same.
The *vocalized lexeme* is an idealized (aka *paradigmatic*), pointed representation of the lexeme,
which may or may not occur in the text.
The [g_lex](g_lex.md) is the realized lexeme in a concrete occurrence, of which it may be a part.
