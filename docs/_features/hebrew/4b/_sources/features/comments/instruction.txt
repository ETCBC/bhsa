Instruction ``instruction``
---------------------------------------------------
The so called instruction of a clause atom.

This feature is present on objects of type *clause_atom*.

The value is something like ``.q``, ``..``, ``.d``, ``ve``.

This feature has been added to the database in a later stage as package called ``para``.

You can use it in SHEBANQ queries.

If you want to use it in LAF-Fabric, you have to load ``para`` as *annox*.
Consult the `LAF-Fabric API reference on annoxes <http://laf-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/texts/API-reference.html#extra-annotation-packages>`_.

.. caution::
    I prefer a more informative definition.

    Explain why is this a useful feature? Examples needed.
