Welcome
#######

.. caution::
    Version **etcbc4c** is available from
    `text-fabric-data <https://github.com/Dans-labs/text-fabric-data>`_.
    The set of features has changed slightly.
    A corresponding **new version** of this feature documentation is available at
    `text-fabric-data: docs <https://etcbc.github.io/text-fabric-data/features/hebrew/etcbc4c/0_overview.html>`_.
    
    Data version **etcbc4c** is not (yet) available in SHEBANQ, 
    only in 
    `Text-Fabric <https://github.com/Dans-labs/text-fabric/wiki>`_,
    the successor of LAF-Fabric.
    LAF-Fabric stays around in order to run legacy notebooks.
    It is recommended to use **Text-Fabric** for new work.

Welcome to the documentation of `shebanq <http://shebanq.ancient-data.org>`_.
The purpose of this documentation is to help you write MQL queries and 
`LAF-Fabric <http://laf-fabric.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ scripts on the ETCBC4 database of the text of the Hebrew Bible.
It is a reference manual that brings all details you need to know under your finger tips.

The `MQL quick reference guide (pdf) <http://shebanq.ancient-data.org/shebanq/static/docs/MQL-QuickRef.pdf>`_ is a good starting point.
A deeper insight in how MQL is structured and what it can do for you is in Ulrik Petersen's 
`MQL Query Guide (pdf) <http://emdros.org/MQL-Query-Guide.pdf>`_.

For an everyday reference to the ETCBC4 features, start with the :doc:`../features/comments/0_overview`. 

Much material is based on Constantijn Sikkel's
`Description of Quest II Data File Format <http://shebanq.ancient-data.org/shebanq/static/docs/qdf1.33-2014-03-26.pdf>`_.
However, these descriptions are not self-contained, and they have been written for a different representation of the data.

We are in the process of adding more in-depth reference material, not only about the text and its features, but also about
the lexicon.
More information about the lexicon preparation is in `this notebook <https://shebanq.ancient-data.org/shebanq/static/docs/tools/shebanq/lexicon.html>`_.
