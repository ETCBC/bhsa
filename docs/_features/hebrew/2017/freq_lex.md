**frequency-lexeme**

The frequency of a lexeme, measured as the number of occurrences in the whole Hebrew Bible.

This feature is present on objects of type [*lex*](otype).

##### Note
> The BHSA lexicon makes distinctions between homonyms, i.e. distinct lexemes that are spelled identically.
This feature respects that distinction.

##### Hint
> The measures *frequency* and *rank* have been computed for *lexemes* and *occurrences*.
