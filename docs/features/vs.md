**verbal stem**

Stem of the verb that indicates an aspect or constellation of the act expressed by the verb.

This feature is present on objects of type [*word*](otype.md).

The Hebrew verb has multiple stems, and each of these stems can be marked with tense/mood.
For the tenses/moods, see [vt](vt.md).
Not all words have verbal stem (e.g. nouns) and these are marked as `NA`.

Here is the list of possible values. Some values are specific for Aramaic.
