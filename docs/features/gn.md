There are only two genders in the Hebrew Bible, masculine (`m`) and feminine (`f`).
Not all words have gender (e.g. adverbs) and these are marked as `NA`.
There are words that do have gender, but whose gender class is unknown to us,
because thet only occur in forms that do not mark it;
these are marked as `unknown`.
