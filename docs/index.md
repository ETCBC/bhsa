# Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (Amstelodamensis)

This is the
[text-fabric]({{tfd}})
version of the Hebrew Bible Database,
containing the text of the Hebrew Bible augmented with linguistic annotations compiled by the
[Eep Talstra Centre for Bible and Computer]({{institute}}), VU University Amsterdam.

The text is based on the
[Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia]({{dbgAcademic}})
edited by Karl Elliger and Wilhelm Rudolph,
Fifth Revised Edition, edited by Adrian Schenker,
© 1977 and 1997 Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart.

The [text-fabric]({{tfd}}) version has been prepared
by Dirk Roorda [Data Archiving and Networked Services]({{dans}}),
with thanks to
Martijn Naaijer,
Cody Kingham,
and Constantijn Sikkel.

There are more formats in which the data is available.
In the `shebanq` subdirectory you find data in MQL format and in MYSQL format that directly goes into
the SHEBANQ website.

In the
[bigTables]({{repoBase}}/programs/bigTables.ipynb)
you find ways to export the complete data as one big table, and store it in R format or in Pandas format.
The notebooks 
[bigTablesP]({{repoBase}}/programs/bigTablesP.ipynb)
and
[bigTablesR]({{repoBase}}/programs/bigTablesR.ipynb)
show you a few things that you can do in R and Pandas.

## Provenance
The source data resides on a server of the ETCBC, managed by Constantijn Sikkel.
He makes that data available as an [MQL]({{mql}}) database dump,
together with supplementary data files.
From there it is transported to this GitHub repo by means of a [pipeline]({{org}}/pipeline).

This dataset contains several versions of the BHSA, from 2011 till now.
When you navigate to a version, you'll see more information about that version and its provenance.

For all versions the
[pipeline]({{org}}/pipeline)
has been followed.
For the newer versions, starting with `2016`, additional data is available in other repositories.
**See the footer of this page**.

In text-fabric it is easy to load the features of several datasets in one session.

## References
We have compiled a list of [references](references.md) to give an impression by what principles
and methods the ETCBC has carried out its text analyses.

## Workflow
The pipeline above is complicated and not free of
[cruft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruft).
It would be better if the ETCBC could deliver its core data directly in text-fabric format,
with inclusion of the lexical features, the ketiv-qere data and the paragraph numbers.
But at least all the fine distinctions that need to be made between versions have been diagnosed and dealt with
in this pipeline.

## Reproducible science
We intend to follow a practice that allows for data updates on the one hand, and reproduction of old
results on the other.

Besides the continuously changing version `c`, we have the fixed, year-bound versions.
In SHEBANQ, 
it will not be possible to publish queries and annotations executed against the `c` version.
It is likely that they will break, when version `c` is modified, week after week.
So, saved queries against this version are not guaranteed to show their original results.

For reliable query saving, every one or two years a new fixed version,
called `2017`, `2019`, ... will be added to SHEBANQ.

Fixed versions in SHEBANQ will remain there forever, and publishing queries and annotations against fixed
versions will remain supported.

In particular, versions `3`, `4` and `4b` are here to stay.
Version `3` because it is relatively old, and represents an earlier stage in the
feature organization of this database.
Versions `4` and `4b` because queries have been published that are based on them.

These versions are also firmly entrenched in the academic record, by virtue of being archived.
