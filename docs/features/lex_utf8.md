**lexeme -consonantal-Hebrew**


The consonantal representation of the lexeme of a word occurrence in Hebrew script.

This feature is present on objects of type [*word*](otype).

Only the consonants of the lexeme are present: no vowel pointing and no other diacritical marks.

##### Note
> There is **no** disambiguation material at the end of the value, like [lex0](lex0) but in contrast with [lex](lex).

##### Hint
> It is difficult to enter Hebrew text. One of the handiest ways to get Hebrew text into a query is to copy and paste it
from some other Hebrew text, e.g. from the [SHEBANQ]({{shebanq}}).

> You could try to copy and paste Hebrew text into a word processor, then remove all diacritics, and paste the result into
your query as a value for [lex_utf8](lex_utf8).
