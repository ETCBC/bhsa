Word -consonantal-Hebrew ``g_cons_utf8``
---------------------------------------------------------------------
:doc:`frequency table of values <../index/g_cons_utf8>`

The consonantal representation of a word occurrence in Hebrew script.

This feature is present on objects of type *word*.

Only the consonants of the word occurrence are present: no vowel pointing and no other diacritical marks.

.. hint::
    It is difficult to enter Hebrew text. One of the handiest ways to get Hebrew text into a query is to copy and paste it
    from some other Hebrew text, e.g. from the `SHEBANQ <http://shebanq.ancient-data.org>`_.

    You could try to copy and paste Hebrew text into a word processor, then remove all diacritics, and paste the result into
    your query as a value for :doc:`g_cons <g_cons>`.
