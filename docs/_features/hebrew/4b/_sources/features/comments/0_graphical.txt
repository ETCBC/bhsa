.. caution::
    Version **etcbc4c** is available from
    `text-fabric-data <https://github.com/Dans-labs/text-fabric-data>`_.
    The set of features has changed slightly.
    A corresponding **new version** of this feature documentation is available at
    `text-fabric-data: docs <https://etcbc.github.io/text-fabric-data/features/hebrew/etcbc4c/0_overview.html>`_.
    
    Data version **etcbc4c** is not (yet) available in SHEBANQ, 
    only in 
    `Text-Fabric <https://github.com/Dans-labs/text-fabric/wiki>`_,
    the successor of LAF-Fabric.
    LAF-Fabric stays around in order to run legacy notebooks.
    It is recommended to use **Text-Fabric** for new work.

Features with different representations
=======================================

There are a number of features that occur in several different forms.
Besides the plain form, there is also a *graphical* form, indicated by a ``g_`` prefix attached to the feature name.
And mostly there is a corresponding feature with a ``g_`` prefix and an ``_utf8`` suffix.
This distinction is between abstract values and concrete values.
Abstract values belong to the art of grammar, they act as identifiers and correspond to certain grammatical properties,
e.g. person, number, gender.
Concrete values are strings that actually occur in the text.

Let us have a closer look to the morpheme features in the table below.

================ ==================== ==============================  ==================  =========================
:doc:`nme <nme>` :doc:`g_nme <g_nme>` :doc:`g_nme_utf8 <g_nme_utf8>`  nominal ending      ``/`` ``/IJM`` ``/@H``
:doc:`pfm <pfm>` :doc:`g_pfm <g_pfm>` :doc:`g_pfm_utf8 <g_pfm_utf8>`  preformative        ``!!`` ``!J.I!`` ``!TI!``
:doc:`prs <prs>` :doc:`g_prs <g_prs>` :doc:`g_prs_utf8 <g_prs_utf8>`  pronominal suffix   ``+OW`` ``+IJ`` ``+HEM``
:doc:`uvf <uvf>` :doc:`g_uvf <g_uvf>` :doc:`g_uvf_utf8 <g_uvf_utf8>`  univalent final     ``~@H`` ``~IJ`` ``~OW``
:doc:`vbe <vbe>` :doc:`g_vbe <g_vbe>` :doc:`g_vbe_utf8 <g_vbe_utf8>`  verbal ending       ``[`` ``[W.`` ``[T.IJ``
:doc:`vbs <vbs>` :doc:`g_vbs <g_vbs>` :doc:`g_vbs_utf8 <g_vbs_utf8>`  root formation      ``]]`` ``]NI]`` ``]HA]``
================ ==================== ==============================  ==================  =========================

Paradigmatic
------------
The plain form of the feature is called the *paradigmatic* form. So the value of ``vbe`` is the paradigmatic verbal ending.
This is a string that looks like the consonantal representation (in transcription) of the morpheme in question,
but it probably is not *realized* that way in the text. The paradigmatic form really is an abstract entity.
In case that some endings have the same consonantal representation, they are disambiguated by postfixing one or more ``=`` signs.
See for example the ``T``, ``T=``, and ``T==`` values in the :doc:`frequency table of vbe <../index/vbe>`.

Graphical
---------
The representation in the ``g_`` variant of the feature is called the *graphical* or *realized* form.
This is the form as it is realized in the concrete word occurrence in question, with the understanding that accents are left out,
because they are not morpheme-bound but word- or syllable-bound.
So here we find a string consisting of consonants, vowel pointings and possibly dagesh and raphe.

In particular, the *paradigmatic* value ``TJ`` for ``vbe`` may be realized by the one of the following *graphical* values
for ``g_vbe``: ``T.IJ`` ``TIJ`` ``OWTIJ`` ``TI`` .

For a complete listing of all *graphical* forms and their corresponding *paradigmatic* forms of all these features, follow
the *frequency table* link in the respective feature descriptions.
(These lists have been generated by means of this
`LAF-Fabric notebook <https://shebanq.ancient-data.org/shebanq/static/docs/tools/shebanq/morphemes.html>`_)

For a more in-depth illustration, see this `query <https://shebanq.ancient-data.org/hebrew/text?mr=r&qw=q&iid=495>`_ by Oliver Glanz.

The graphical representation does not have disambiguation symbols (``=``) in its representation.

The graphical features have one or two special ascii characters in them, indicating (redundantly) the feature.
All ``g_vbe`` values start with a ``[``, all ``g_nme`` values with a ``/``.
The presence of these characters will not be continued in future versions of the data.

Graphical, unicode
------------------
Finally, the ``g_`` ... ``_utf8`` versions of these features contain the graphical (=realized) value in Hebrew script, in Unicode.
The encoding is ``utf8``, but for most applications the user does not have to be aware of the encoding.
