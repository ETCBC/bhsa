**language**


The language a word (or rather lexeme) belongs to.

This feature is present on objects of type [*word* and *lex*](otype).

There are only two languages in the Hebrew Bible.
Aramaic is, like Hebrew, a semitic language.
The ISO-639 codes and descriptions of these languages are:

MQL | ISO-639-code ISO-639 description | name
---|---|---
`Hebrew` |`hbo` |    Ancient Hebrew
`Aramaic`|`arc` |    Official Aramaic; Imperial Aramaic
