**lexeme -pointed-Hebrew**

The pointed representation of the lexeme of a word occurrence in Hebrew script.

This feature is present on objects of type [*word*](otype.md).

The vowels and consonants of the word lexeme are present; a lexeme does not have other diacritical marks.

##### Note
> There is no disambiguation material at the end of the value such as in [lex](lex.md).

##### Hint
> It is difficult to enter Hebrew text. One of the handiest ways to get Hebrew text into a query is to copy and paste it
from some other Hebrew text, e.g. from the [SHEBANQ]({{shebanq}}).

You could try to copy and paste Hebrew text into a word processor, then remove all diacritics, and paste the result into
your query as a value for [g_lex_utf8](g_lex_utf8.md).
